The Great Soul-Swap Adventure Simulator 2k14 Ultimate Edition - Indoors Expansion Pack 2.0 (GSSAS to its friends) is an adventure game that illustrates how the way we see the world changes based on our perspective.

INTRODUCTION

WALKTHROUGH

CONTROLS
MOVEMENT
Different beings move around the world in different ways; a person can only walk across the floor, but a spider can crawl up the walls. A mouse can scurry through tiny holes in the skirting board and a bird can fly through windows. You can move around the world using the W, A, S and D keys, but remember; your puppet may not be as nimble as others and you may find you need something more nimble to progress.

INTERACTION
The E key is used to interact with the world. It has two context-sensitive functions; using objects and possessing living beings.

POSSESSING LIVING BEINGS
Each being sees some other beings as important, but completely ignores others. A person would largely ignore a mouse or spider but would notice something larger, like a cat or a bird. A cat, meanwhile, would certainly notice the mouse; that's lunch. You can possess beings your puppet has noticed by pressing the E key while standing next to them.

USING OBJECTS
In a similar manner to objects, different beings similarly notice different things about the world around them. Where a person sees a window, a bird sees a door to the open world. Where a cat sees hours of fun, a human only sees a lost ball of twine. Objects that appear interesting to your puppet can be interacted with by the use of the E key.
